### Getting a Gig
* [Cassidy Williams' Guide for Getting a Gig](https://github.com/cassidoo/getting-a-gig)  
  Oriented towards college students.
* [A Freshman's Guide to Tech Internships](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18XaP0nRU2fS-i-uxxWpvAy41hD_UF3rzjiJRouqF_Gc/edit)  
  Specifically written for college first-years. Tons of information about what
  companies are looking for, as well as a list of freshman-specific and
  freshman-friendly programs.
* [How to cold-email a startup into giving you an internship](https://creator.wework.com/knowledge/get-startup-job-internship-cold-email/)  

##### NOTE
As soon as you're at this stage of getting a gig, go read the negotiation
articles below; don't wait until you get an offer. Negotiation starts when you're
asked for your previous and/or expected salary, which may be in your first
conversation with a recruiter.

### Opportunities

### Interviewing
* [Front End Developer Interview Questions](http://h5bp.github.io/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions/)  
  Tons of them. From HTML5 Boilerplate.

  ask for more money and explains how to go for it. This is a must-read if you're
  not confident about asking for more money.

  inevitably come up during negotiation.
